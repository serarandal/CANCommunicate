# CANCommunicate
CanCommunicate is a GUI tool that provides enough utility to be able to send and receive messages through can devices using an adapter such as usb2can.
## Installation
In future you will be able to find the executable on the releases window.
## Usage
Ejecute the app and enjoy.
You will need to create some files yourself, such as the Messages and Logs folder, and the devices.txt, frequency.txt and password.txt.
The app is currently not working on Windows, waiting on 8devices or python-can to release a driver update for korlan usb2can devices.
